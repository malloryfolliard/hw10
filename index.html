	<p> 1. The API that I selected is a datbase with a list of cocktails. A random cocktail is presented below. Displayed is the name of the cocktail and instructions on how to make it. </p>
	<p> 2. This API can be found at the site <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php" target ="_blank"> here. </a> </p>
	<p> 3. The options that I used include ... </p>
	<p> 4. Two applications in which this API would be helpful would be (1) if somebody is looking to make a specific drink that is provided in the API and needs instructions and (2) if somebody is looking for a new drink to make and would like a random one generated. </p>
